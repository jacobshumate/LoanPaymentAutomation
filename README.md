# LoanPaymentAutomation

This a personal project that was developed in C# using Selenium in Visual Studio 2015. The Windows application uses Selenium Webdriver to automate a Firefox web browser. It reads data from a local file which is used to enter the url, credentials and payment amounts. Each page is scanned for the addresses of specific html elements that are used to navigate through the website and finally submit the total amount of all payments. The last page auto checks to send an email to the user and a text file is generated to log the date of execution.
